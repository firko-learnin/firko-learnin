### Hey there 👋

My name is Jack Firkin and I'm a full stack software developer from Birmingham, UK with a passion for tech and problem solving. 

After several years working in the financial services industry I decided to take my interest in tech to the next level and pursue a full-time career in software development by joining [The School of Code's](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) 16 week intensive full stack bootcamp.
